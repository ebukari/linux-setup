The following is a list of steps I want to take to setup a newly installed Ubuntu/Derivatives system. Don't write any code yet. Just understand the process. There are other details to provide

Steps
---
1. Update package list
2. Remove packages specified to be uninstalled
3. Install packages needed for setup to run successfully
4. Setup PPAs
5. Install programs & software
- Install packages with the package manager that don't need a source to be added
- Add all the custom sources/ppa's specified with the setup script or source parameter
- Update the package list
- Install all the packages with custom sources
- Install the ones with custom installers
6. Upgrade
7. Setup dotfiles
8. Implement settings

The packages to be installed/removed and the settings to implement will be specified in a .yaml file:
installs:
  apt:
    - name: Visual Studio Code (OSS)
      package: codium
      source_script: vscodium.sh
    - name: Cheat Sheet
      package: cht.sh
    - name: Qbittorrent
      package: qbittorrent
      source: ppa:qbittorrent-team/qbittorrent-stable
  flatpak:
    - name: Bitwarden
      package: com.bitwarden.desktop
  commands:
    - name: Rust Programming Language
      package: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
uninstalls:
  apt:
    - name: LibreOffice
      package: libreoffice*
settings:
  commands:
    - name: Enable Firewall
      command: sudo ufw enable
  scripts:
    - name: Disable touchscreen
      script: disable_touchscreen.sh

commands section of installs/uninstalls is for programs/software that can be installed/uninstalled with a command but not through a package manager
custom sections of installs/uninstalls is for programs/software that require series of commands and therefore is better done with a script
Scripts for installs/uninstalls and source addition will be found under installers directory
Scripts for settings will be found in the config directory
Scripts that contain functions for the tool can be found in utils directory

There are several ways a package can be installed:
1. when only a package name is supplied you can go ahead and use the package manager to install it.
2. when a source is provided then that source must be added e.g ppa for nala/apt using the relevant commands
3. when a source_script is specified, the script sets up the source and then the package manager can be used to install it.
4. when a command is specified, the software/package can be installed using the command
5. when the installation is custom, a script is provided that installs the software/program

The script should be able to do the following:
1. Present all software and settings listed in the yaml document and allow you to choose which to install/Implement
2. Install all chosen software/packages and implement all settings
3. Follow all the steps specified in the steps section
4. Be able to work with any of the package managers specified in the packages section except the package manager is not present on that system and cannot be installed
5. Have an option to implement all settings and install all software i.e a quiet option
6. Show nice output so that the user can see which actions succeeded or which actions failed

Bash parsing of yaml is not consistent. It is better to convert to json and then parse it with bash
